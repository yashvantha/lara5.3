The Hollow Men
by Is. Elm

I

We are the norm men

We are the Stuffed men
Leamng together

Heaapece awed wtn straw. Mas!
our area vorces, when

We wnrsper together

Are qmet and meanrngress

As wrnd rn dry grass

or rats’feet over broken gas
In our dry new

shape wthout form, shade wthout comr,
rararysed force, gesture wtnout melon,

Those who have crossed

wtn arect eyes, to death's other ngdom
Remember usif at a‘Fnol as Lost

morent SOULS, but 0an

As the how»: men

The stuffed men.
